This git tree comes from the old avrora cvs tree that was imported into git using the update.sh command (provided in the root of the tree)
This git repository includes a branch "Find Gadgets" that includes a tool 
to search for gadgets in AVR binaries using heuristics, that tool
was also automatically constructing final payloads with gadgets found.
It was efficient but probably not optimal... The tool is based on
AVRORA, which already took care of the disassembly. 

This tool was used in "Code injection attacks on harvard-architecture devices"
