/**
 * The <code>DeltaQueue</code> class implements an amortized constant time
 * delta-queue for processing of scheduled events. Events are put into the queue
 * that will fire at a given number of cycles in the future. An internal delta
 * list is maintained where each link in the list represents a set of triggers
 * to be fired some number of clock cycles after the previous link.
 * <p/>
 * Each delta between links is maintained to be non-zero. Thus, to insert a
 * trigger X cycles in the future, at most X nodes will be skipped over. Therefore
 * over X time steps, this cost is amortized to be constant.
 * <p/>
 * For each clock cycle, only the first node in the list must be checked, leading
 * to constant time work per clock cycle.
 * <p/>
 * This class allows the clock to be advanced multiple ticks at a time.
 * <p/>
 * Also, since this class is used heavily in the simulator, its performance is
 * important and maintains an internal cache of objects. Thus, it does not create
 * garbage over its execution and never uses more space than is required to store
 * the maximum encountered simultaneous events. It does not use standard libraries,
 * casts, virtual dispatch, etc.
